## üß† KPIs & DAX Measures

Custom DAX was used to calculate and assess:

- **CTR (Click Through Rate)**
- **CPC (Cost Per Click)**
- **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**
- **Conversion Rate**
- **Simulated Revenue** (fixed value per conversion)
- **KPI Status Tags** using thresholds and SWITCH logic

‚úÖ **Score-based icons** were used to show status with traffic-light-style visuals.
